## Exploratory data analysis. Research of apartment sale ads:

You have at your disposal the data of the real estate sales service â€” an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. To do this, conduct a exploratory analysis of the data and set the parameters that affect the price of the objects. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track down anomalies and fraudulent activity.

## Used libraries:

matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sklearn

## Conclusions:

In this project, the following tasks were set: to perform data preprocessing and study them in order to find interesting features and dependencies that exist in the real estate market.

I started the work by uploading the data and determining the correct separator. After that, I built histograms for the initial estimation of outliers in the data. According to the histograms, it was immediately determined that those that are associated with the area, price and ceiling height are knocked out. The ceiling height data reaches 100 m, which is clearly an error. This may be due to the fact that some data may be specified in decimeters rather than meters. The price and area may well be real, but rare.

Omissions were identified at the data preprocessing stage. Some of the gaps were filled with median values, some were filled with zeros or logical values. Also at this stage, the data types in some columns were changed. In the date and time column, the data type was changed from str to datetime. Replaced the data type from float64 to float32 to save memory. I changed float64 to float32 and int64 to int32. Implicit duplicates in the column with localities were also removed. The outlier values were also replaced or deleted. As a result, 4.28% of the rows were deleted.

Several new columns have been added: the price of one meter, day of the week, month, year, type of apartment floor, distance to the city center in kilometers.

The distribution features of some parameters were studied, such as price, area, number of rooms, ceiling height, apartment floor, apartment floor type, etc. a. It turned out that there are fewer publications on the sale of apartments on weekends than on weekdays.

b. The lowest number of publications was recorded in the months with the largest number of holidays: May and January

c. Speaking about the speed of apartment sales, we can say the following: the median number of days of apartment sales is 94. In half of the cases, apartments are sold for a period of 44 to 228 days

d. It was also noticed that a lot of apartments are sold in 45 and 60 days.

e. The factor that most affects the price of an apartment is its area.

f. The 10 localities with the largest number of ads were identified. St. Petersburg is in the first place, Vyborg is on the 10th.

g. It was also determined that, on average, in St. Petersburg, the price of an apartment decreases by 227 thousand rubles with each kilometer from the city center.

h. The relationship between the average price of an apartment and the type of floor was revealed. It turned out that apartments are cheaper on the ground floor, followed by apartments on the last floor. Apartments that do not belong to the two listed categories turned out to be the most expensive.
