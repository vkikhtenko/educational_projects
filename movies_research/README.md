Educational project: Movies
You need to study the Russian film distribution market and identify current trends. Pay attention to the films that have received government support. Try to answer the question of how interesting such films are to the viewer.

You will work with the data published on the open data portal of the Ministry of Culture. The dataset contains information about rental certificates, fees and government support for films, as well as information from the KinoPoisk website.
